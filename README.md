# Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Billy and I'm a software engineering student at the University of Ottawa. As a classically trained pianist and composer turned techie, I love to approach problems creatively. Let's collaborate on something. I'm sure we can find a way to make the world a better place. ðŸ˜‰
